# Mill Valley Town Hall
26 Corte Madera Ave, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

Mill Valley had already been an incorporated city for nine years when the City Council was finally able to convene in its own two-story structure on Corte Madera Avenue in 1909.  The new building was originally expected to house the fire department’s fire wagons and equipment, and eventually stable its fire horses.  But plans changed during construction, and city trustees determined the building should also house the Town Hall.  It all began with the purchase of Lot 21 in 1902.

Lot 21 was a vacant redwood grove in 1902; previously it was used as a campground by workers who graded Mill Valley’s first streets and by men who helped build the early Mountain Railway.  But with the land purchase, the city’s fire volunteers began storing their equipment on the site, and soon after, the city authorized the construction of a fire house there.  In the meantime, the city had been renting space in various downtown locations to hold town meetings and to house the city clerk’s office.  

By early 1908, fire department volunteers had cleared the redwood trees and donated their services to build the Fire House.  They completed a 20 foot by 50 foot two story wood structure on Lot 21 and painted it yellow.  Downstairs held a stable for fire horses, and space for carts, harnesses and fire wagons.  In December of that year, the city’s trustees approved completion of the unfinished upper floor of the Fire House, but instead of housing storage and lockers for fire uniforms, the city decided to use the upper floor to conduct Mill Valley’s official town meetings.  On April 14, 1909, the city held its first town hall meeting in its new home. 

But the building became inadequate by the 1930s, and when the property adjacent to the combined Town Hall/Fire House became available due to delinquent payment of taxes, the City’s Board of Trustees purchased it.  The old two-story structure was demolished in early 1936 and construction of a new building spanning the two lots began.  The new Town Hall building was dedicated on August 1, 1936 and housed the fire department, the police department, city offices and council chambers. Today, the downtown division of the city’s fire department still resides on Lot 21, and city meetings still take place on its adjacent property.
